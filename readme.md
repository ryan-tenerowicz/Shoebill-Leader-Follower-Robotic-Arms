![Shoebill Banner](photos/DUAL_ARMS_BCKGND.jpeg)

An open source leader-follower robotic arm system with 7 degrees of freedom, made by Vassar Robotics - inspired by GELLO kinematics, compatible with LeRobot software and common arms in the market (ARX, Trossen, I2RT, etc.)


## Overview

**Shoebill is a leader-follower robotic arm system featuring:**

* **7 DoF articulated movement** with FeeTech servo motors
* **Leader/Follower teleoperation** with 1:1 joint mapping
* **Force feedback capability** via torque position setting
* **LeRobot compatibility** for ACT training policy infrastructure
* **Open source SDK** with pip-installable Vassar-FeeTech servo SDK

## Key Features

### Leader Arm
* **GELLO-Inspired Leader Arm Design** - Follows identical kinematics as ARX, Trossen, and I2RT follower arms
* **Custom Torsion-Spring Gripper** - Easy-to-use, normally-open design
* **FeeTech HLS3625 Servos** - Torque position setting capability for force-feedback paradigms

### Follower Arm
* **UMI-Inspired End Effector** - Compliant TPU material for higher dexterity
* **7 Degrees of Freedom** - More closely mimics human joint structure than 6 DoF
* **12V FeeTech Servos** - 3 NÂ·m output torque for more robust performance
